                    Wow! This tour made me realize how much I love mountains. After going on one of these tours, I can
                    safely say that they are my favorite geographic feature, and my favorite word starts with 'M'

                    I've been on a lot of tours, but this one was the best. I'm not sure if it was the mountain or the
                    mountain air, but I've never felt so high in my life.

                    I'm not sure if I can put into words how much I love mountains. I've always been a fan of hills, but
                    this tour really opened my eyes to mountains. I can't wait to go on another one!
